"Absolutely—here’s a fun roast of the resume! (Please remember, roasting is all in good fun and not meant to offend. 😄)\n\n---\n\n**ABHINAY JANGDE’S RESUME ROAST**\n\n1. **Contact Overload:**  \n   Wow, one email, GitHub, LinkedIn... what’s next, carrier pigeon? Where’s your Discord tag and Tinder profile?\n\n2. **Summary Section:**  \n   “Full Stack Web Developer | MERN & Next.js” — Bold! Most people put “aspiring,” you just went for it. “Passionate about designing efficient architectures”—translates to: “Once spent four hours optimizing a for-loop to save 10 milliseconds.”\n\n3. **Project Names:**\n   - **CODESIDE** and **CODEBHAIYA**? So you just put “CODE” in front of everything you do? What’s next, CODECOFFEE—an app to order coffee while coding?\n   - But hey, at least you’re team ‘bro’—your sidekick project is literally ‘Bhaiya.’\n\n4. **Tech Stack Parade:**  \n   Dude, you listed more stacks than a Jenga competition. Next.js, Typescript, Prisma, Redux, Docker, Tailwind, PostgreSQL... Is there an end? Did you just list every JS buzzword from a 2024 roadmap?\n\n5. **Tiny Timelines:**  \n   CODESIDE “Nov 2024 – Feb 2025.”  \n   Are you time traveling or just updating your resume *in advance*? That’s the kind of confidence we all need: “I’ll build this next year. Put it on the CV now.”\n\n6. **Internships:**  \n   “Worked on a Car Number Plate Detector project with a team of three.” – So basically, you and your friends tried to make an ANPR and Dockerized Hello World, right?  \n   “Managed containerized environments.” Wow, fancy way of saying ‘ran Docker Compose’ once.\n\n7. **Technical Skills:**  \n   “JavaScript (Expert)” – So you’ve really mastered ‘console.log’ then?\n   “Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)” – You’re officially a Windows enjoyer pretending to be a real Linux dev.\n   “GenAI: Langchain, RAG, VectorDB, OpenAI...” – We get it, you’ve built a ChatGPT clone like everyone else.\n\n8. **Education:**  \n   “CGPA: 7.8/10 (Rounded up to the nearest win).”\n   “Relevant Courses: Data Structures, etc.” – When in doubt, add \"etc.\"\n\n9. **Achievements:**  \n   “Python Course: I have created a Python [course] for beginners in Hindi on YouTube.” – Flexing that YouTube grind. When’s the ‘Unboxing my Resume’ video coming out?\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \nA classic case of “Why use three words when you can use thirty technologies in one resume?”  \nBut hey, at least you don’t claim to be a ninja, rockstar, or wizard. Yet.\n\nKeep coding, future CodeUstaad! 🚀\n\n---\n\n*Want a serious review or more tips for improvement? Let me know!*"
